# Test Information 'What to Test' Section for TestFlight Beta Testing

Please note that any feedback I receive is useful, whether you just spend 3 minutes or 30!

Throughout the process feel free to do whatever you want including randomly clicking buttons, scrolling, adding/editing and even deleting data (don't worry, all data is localized so it can easily be restored). If something breaks awesome, I can fix it now before it hits the App Store. 

Some of the things I am interested in learning about include:

* Usability: How easy it is to navigate and understand the features without having necessarily read the documentation?

* Performance: How well does the App perform on your device? Any slowness?

* Aesthetics: How would you change the look? (this includes buttons, fonts, and colors combinations)

* Functionality: Do things work as you expect them to? If not, how would you change them?

* Accuracy: Are the results produced what you might expect? (I have uncovered some areas where App needs improvement)

Below are a few areas to get you started and/or feel free to view docs accessible from rgbutterfly.com

From the Main (default) View:
* Test all the buttons in this view (at any point the back button, cancel, or home button will get you back)
* Try switching between displays using the middle "list" button at the bottom
* For each type of display (i.e., keyword) try using the alphabetical index  and/or search button (top right) to filter results
* At any point, clicking on a row will take you to a view with a higher level of detail (you can always go back by clicking on the back arrow or home button)
* Next click on the top-left button on the navigation bar to access the photo library or take a photo (make sure you allow the App to access these features in your general settings)
* For each view/display, try rotating back and forth between landscape and portrait and see how it affects the layout (note that the image view doesn't respond to landscape orientation)

From the Image View (following photo selection):
* Once you incorporate a photo try tapping on different areas of the photo and watch the collection views appear at the bottom (tapping on that same area will make it disappear along with its associated collection view)
* Move the photo around to uncover new areas
* Try overloading the photo with tapped areas (and then delete them)
* The bottom collection views are scrollable and clicking on one will take you to a detail view (the top left back arrow will get you back)
* Try out the up/down arrows next to the "Match Method and Count" header to change the relative sizes of image/collection views
* Try editing or deleting any of these views or items (usually done by clicking the top-right 'Edit' button)
* Feel free to modify existing associations (i.e., Match Associations or Color Associations)

From the Image View (following photo selection):
* Click the 'Match' button to switch to 'Assoc'
* Tap areas in this mode and create a Color Association

From the Swatch Detail View (accessible from any swatch listing):
* Edit any parameter/save
* Try adding keywords and see if they render in the Main View Keywords display

From the Settings View (accessible by clicking the bottom-right gear button on most views):
* Test any (or all) settings and see how they affect the App behavior
* Be sure to visit the About/Disclaimer sections and clicking on the URLs
* Try the "Provide Feedback" and share buttons
